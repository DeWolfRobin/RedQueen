# RedQueen
The **Red Queen Command &amp; Control system** is, as its name suggests, related to the [King In The Middle](https://gitlab.com/DeWolfRobin/KingInTheMiddle). Instead of being out in the field like the King, the queen is at the home-base as a C&amp;C center.

I try my best to keep this secure but it is highly discouraged to run this remotely as this can have some security vulnerabilities by design.
